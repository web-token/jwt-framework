<!--
Replace this notice by a short README for your feature/bugfix. This will help people
understand your PR and can be used as a start for the documentation.

Additionally:
- Always add tests and ensure they pass.
- Never break backward compatibility (unless you are working on the next major release branch).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply
    (lowest branches are regularly merged to upper ones so they get the fixes too.)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the last major branch (e.g. 1.x).
